## Problem Statement
The hotel management system is designed to handle the following functionalities:
- **Hotel Staff**: Each staff member has an ID, name, age, hire date, contact number, address, and role.
- **Guests**: Each guest has a national ID, name, address, contact number, vehicle ownership status, and marital status.
- **Rooms**: Each room has a number, capacity, and the floor it is located on.
- **Cleaning**: Staff members are responsible for cleaning the rooms.
- **Reservations**: Guests can reserve a room through staff members for a specified date.
- **Checkout**: Guests settle their bills through the staff.
- **Parking**: Guests can park their vehicles in parking spots. Each parking spot has an ID, floor, and status (occupied or vacant).
- **Accessible Areas**: Guests can utilize various accessible areas. These areas have an ID, capacity, and type.
- **Events**: Events are organized in accessible areas and each event has an ID and a name.
- **Dining Areas**: The hotel offers dining areas, each with an ID, name, capacity, and type.
- **Dining Orders**: Guests can order food through the dining areas. External customers can also place orders.

The project includes UML diagrams to illustrate the structure and relationships within the system:
- Class Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- Use Case Diagram
- Activity Diagram

## ER Diagrams

The ER diagrams detail the database structure and relationships between different entities such as Staff, Guests, Rooms, Parking, Accessible Areas, Dining Areas, and Events.

## Features
- Comprehensive management of hotel staff, guests, rooms, dining areas, and events.
- Efficient handling of reservations, checkouts, and food orders.
- Parking management for guests with vehicles.
- Event organization within accessible areas.
- Visual representation through UML and ER diagrams.
